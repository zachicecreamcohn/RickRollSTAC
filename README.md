2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Once the file has downloaded, unzip it. Keep track of where the unzipped file is saved.
4. navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (type it into your browser the same way you would navigate to a site like `instagram.com`).
5. On this page, toggle "Developer mode" on.
6. On the top left, the option to "Load unpacked" will now be available. *Click it*.
7. Navigate to the unzipped file from steps 1-3 and select it.
8. That's it! Navigate to [WebSTAC](https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/) and give it a try.
